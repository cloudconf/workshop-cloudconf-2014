# AWS & PHP Workshop

## Install and checks

First of all you have to install a base system and check that all works correctly.

```
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install

php check.php
```

If you see the message "All done! Congrats, see you then at CloudConf 2014" you are
ready to our CloudConf 2014 AWS & PHP Workshop!
